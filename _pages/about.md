Georgios Zervakis is an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics Department (CEID)](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en), [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/), Greece, since September 2022. Before joining CEID, he was a Research Group Leader at the [Chair for Embedded Systems (CES)](https://ces.itec.kit.edu/), [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/), Germany. During his time at CES (August 2019 - September 2022), he led research initiatives focusing on digital design for approximate and machine-learning circuits. Dr. Zervakis received the Diploma and Ph.D. degrees from the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en), [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece, in 2012 and 2018, respectively. Following the completion of his Ph.D., he continued his academic pursuits as a post-doctoral researcher at NTUA before joining KIT a year later.  Additionally, Dr. Zervakis has worked in many EU-funded research projects as a research associate of the Institute of Communication and Computer Systems (ICCS), Athens, Greece (Dec 2015-Aug 2019). As a member of KIT he worked on a German Research Foundation (DFG) project. He actively participates in academic communities, serving as a reviewer for several IEEE and ACM Transactions journals and is also a technical program committee member of the major design conferences (incl. DAC, DATE, ICCAD). His main research interests include digital design, low-power, accelerator microarchitectures, approximate computing, design automation, circuit synthesis and optimization, emerging technologies,  printed electronics, and machine learning.
