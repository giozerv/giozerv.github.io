SoftNeuro is a project focused on the development of resource-constrained artificial intelligence for soft robotics and wearables, utilizing neuromorphic systems and soft electronics. The project aims to create a new paradigm for artificial intelligence that overcomes the limitations of traditional computing in soft and wearable devices. The project will leverage the latest advances in neuromorphic systems and soft electronics to create a new generation of intelligent soft devices that can operate in resource-constrained environments, while providing a more natural and intuitive interaction with humans.

The project is completed. This project has received funding from the Excellence Initiative of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.<br/>
